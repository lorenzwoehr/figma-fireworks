## Getting Started
Before installing, you'll need to compile the code using the TypeScript compiler. To install TypeScript, first [install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Then:
```
$ npm install -g typescript
```

Next install the packages that the plugin depends on:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/lorenzwoehr/figma-fireworks
$ cd figma-fireworks
$ npm install
```

Compile the plugin:
```
$ npm run build
```

Now you can import the plugin from within the Figma desktop app (`Plugins > Development > Import plugin from manifest...` from the right-click menu)!


## How to use
Just run the plugin, delete any layer(s) and watch the magic happen! âœ¨
